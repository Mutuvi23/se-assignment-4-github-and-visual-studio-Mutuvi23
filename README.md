Assignment: GitHub and Visual Studio
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of GitHub and Visual Studio. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Introduction to GitHub:

What is GitHub, and what are its primary functions and features? Explain how it supports collaborative software development.

Github:is a web-based git repository hosting service ,which offers all of the distrubuted revision control and source code management(SCM)functionality of git as well as adding its own features and host  git repositories on a remote server.
Primary functions:
-For working by yourself:
-Gives you a “time machine” for going back to earlier versions
-Gives you great support for different versions (standalone, webapp, etc.) of the same basic project
-For working with others:
-Greatly simplifies concurrent work, merging changes

Features:  
   - Keeps multiple (older and newer) versions of everything (not just source code)
     -Requests comments regarding every change
     -Allows “check in” and “check out” of files so you know which files someone else is working on
     -Displays differences between versions
Github supports collaborative by:
         -Github supports team work by making the use of the repository which makes the project is accessible to every teammate and save the changes.

Repositories on GitHub:
What is a GitHub repository? Describe how to create a new repository and the essential elements that should be included in it.
A github repository is folder or directory in github where any user permitted can access the content of the folder.
or is a centralized location on GitHub where you can store and manage your code, files, and project data.

STEPS: a) login in your github account ,
       b)once in the account,click on profile icon on the top right,
       c)Below your profile,click on your repository,
       d)click on the New,which a green background, then it will take directly to creating a new repository.
       e) click on READ.md to add it.
       f)click on create repository to create.

KEY ELEMENTS: a) name of the repository
              b) select the public instead of private so as to ensure that incase you share the link of repository with any user it will be easy to access. 
             c) Adding READ.md 


            
Version Control with Git:

Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers?
version control makes it easier to have multiple versions of a code base and sometimes across multiple developers or teams.

Remote Repositories: GitHub hosts remote repositories, making it easy for developers to collaborate on projects from anywhere in the world.

Pull Requests: Pull requests are a GitHub feature that allows developers to notify team members about changes they have made in a branch. Pull requests facilitate code review and discussion before merging changes into the main branch.

Issues and Project Management: GitHub includes issue tracking and project management tools, allowing developers to track bugs, feature requests, and project tasks directly within the repository.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): GitHub integrates with various CI/CD tools that automatically build, test, and deploy code changes, ensuring that the codebase remains stable and that new changes do not introduce bugs.

GitHub Actions: GitHub Actions allow developers to automate workflows for their repositories. For example, you can set up automated testing, linting, or deployment processes that run whenever code is pushed to the repository.

Collaborative Features: GitHub provides various collaboration features, such as team management, wikis, and documentation, to help teams work together more efficiently.

Community and Open Source: GitHub is home to a vast number of open-source projects. Developers can contribute to these projects, learn from others, and even use open-source code in their own projects.

Branching and Merging in GitHub:

What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.

Branching is the proess of creating a seperate line of development.
Merging:is the process of combining changes from different branches.

Branching in Git allows developers to work on features, bug fixes, and experiments in isolated environments, facilitating parallel development and robust collaboration. It ensures code quality and stability by enabling focused development, thorough testing, and seamless integration through pull requests and continuous integration.

to create the branch, we use the command git branch feature-branch and use command git checkout feature-branch or use command git checkout -b feature-branch to create and switch to a new branch in one step.

To make changes the following steps are followed:
    1.edit the file as required.
    2.add the changes to repository using command git add .
    3. commit the changes with a message using the command git commit -m "Describe your changes"
    4.push the committed changes into the remote repository using the command git push origin feature-branch

To merge the branch back to the main,the steps are:

1.ensure you are on the main branch using the command git checkout main
2.update(pull latest changes) your main branch with latest changes from the remote repository using the command  git pull origin main
3.merge the changes from the feature branch into the main branch using the command  git merge feature-branch
4.if there is any conflict use the command git add <resolved-file> after resolving the coflicts manually.
5.commit the changes after resolving the conflicts using the command git commit
6.push the updated main branch to the remote repository using the command git push origin main

Pull Requests and Code Reviews:

What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.

pull request is a feature in gitgub that allows developers to notify  team members about the changes thy have made in a branch,facilitating code reviews and collaboration before merging the changes to the main branch. 

steps to create a pull request:

Create a Pull Request:
-Push changes to the feature branch.
-Go to the repository on GitHub.
-Click "New pull request."
-Select the feature branch and the main branch to merge into.
-Add a title and description.
-Click "Create pull request."

Steps to review a pull request

-Team members review the code, leave comments, and suggest changes.
-The author makes revisions if needed and updates the pull request.
-Reviewers approve the pull request after changes are satisfactory.
-Merge the pull request into the main branch.

GitHub Actions:
Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

Github actions is github feature that allows developers to automate workflows directly within repositories.

How it is used:
-create a '.github/workflows' directory in your repository.
-add a YAML file e.g 'main.yml' to define your workflow.
-Specify events that trigger the workflow such as 'push','pull_request',or 'schedule'.
-  Break dowm the workflow into jobs,which are further devidend into steps.Each jon runs on a virtual machine and can include steps .such as checking out the repository ,setting up dependencies ,running tests,and deploying.
-Use pre-built actions from github marketplace or write custom scripts.
-Each step in a job can use an action or script to perform a task.

simple CI/CD:
Define the Workflow: Create a file in .github/workflows directory, e.g., ci-cd.yml.

Configure the Workflow File:

#yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: windows-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test

    - name: Build project
      run: npm run build

    - name: Deploy
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      run: npm run deploy
